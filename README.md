# next_gen_image_comparison

[This site is a github pages site](https://search-laboratory.github.io/next_gen_image_comparison/)

This repo is designed to test the effects of dynamically rendering images as different image types.
In theory, rendering all images as webp should notably increase performance. 

There are 3 versions of the site, which is a singal page: unoptimised, dynamic and webp optimised. Each version has the images loaded differently.
The structure of the site is perfect for test to determine what and if there is a significant different to using next gen images.
